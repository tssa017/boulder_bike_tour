                        The Boulder Bike Tour started over a decade ago with a
                        small group of enthusiastic cyclists. Today, it has
                        grown into one of the most anticipated cycling events in
                        Colorado, attracting riders from all over the globe. The
                        tour offers a unique opportunity to experience the
                        breathtaking landscapes of Boulder, while promoting a
                        sense of community and sportsmanship.

                        Each year, the tour has evolved, introducing new routes
                        and challenges, while maintaining the core spirit of
                        adventure and camaraderie. We are proud of our rich
                        history and the countless memories made along the way.
